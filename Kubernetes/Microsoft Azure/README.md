# Overview:
In this guide, I will show you how to deploy your Kubernetes container globally using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) Kubernetes operator. I'll also demonstrate how to install Ingress NGINX and Istio, along with their integrations, using the Helm package manager.

## Prerequisites:
- [Azure for Students Subscription](https://education.github.com/pack)
- [Azure Command-Line Interface](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?view=azure-cli-latest&pivots=msi)
- [Kubernetes Command-Line Tool (kubectl)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Lens Kubernetes IDE (optional but highly recommended)](https://k8slens.dev/)

## Disclaimer and Best Practices:
- This guide is based on my experience and memory after deactivating my Azure for Students subscription.
- Always document every command you run to keep track of your configuration changes.
- When editing YAML files, include comments explaining the reasons behind each change for future reference.
- This guide consolidates insights from various tutorials and resources. I've included links to all the guides I followed.
